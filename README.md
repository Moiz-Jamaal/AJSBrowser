## 📊 Session Management

### **Student Session Flow**
1. Student enters ITS ID on landing page
2. Session created in AWS database
3. Browser navigates to exam portal
4. Lightweight monitoring tracks browser close only
5. Session ends when browser is closed

### **Session Data Tracked**
- Student ITS ID
- Student Name
- Session start/end times
- Browser version
- Operating system
- IP address
- Session status (active/ended)

### **AWS Backend**
- **Lambda Function**: `AJSExamBrowserAPI`
- **Database**: Aurora MySQL (aurora_iltehaaq)
- **API Gateway**: https://5wgk4koei8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod

- Navigate to Help → Check for Updates

---

## 📱 Admin Features

### **Accessing Admin Menu**
1. Click the footer area 5 times rapidly (within 3 seconds)
2. Admin menu unlocks (no notification for security)

- **Help** → About (version info)
- **Help** → Check for Updates (manual update check)

### **Lock Admin Menu**
- Help → Lock Admin Menu
- Requires 5-click sequence to unlock again

## 🌐 API Endpoints (AWS Lambda)

### **Student Endpoints**
```

POST /api/session/create      # Create exam session
POST /api/session/end         # End session (browser close)
```

### **Session Management**
```
GET  /api/session/status      # Check session status

1. Navigate to the ECS console and select the 'cfContainerCluster' cluster

2. Find and select the service 'cfContainer-ECSFargateService-eXqwkKldcONO'

3. In the service details, go to the 'Health and metrics' tab

4. Review the 'Service events' for any specific error messages related to the task failures

5. Go to the 'Tasks' tab and select the failed task

6. Check the logs of the 'cfContainerContainer' container for any application-specific errors

7. Navigate to the EC2 console and select 'Target Groups' from the left sidebar

8. Find and select the target group 'cfCont-Targe-9PKLMBOY5P8D'

9. Review the 'Health check' settings to ensure they are appropriate for your application:
   - Verify the health check path
   - Check the health check protocol
   - Review the health check port
   - Adjust the healthy and unhealthy threshold counts if necessary

10. In the target group, go to the 'Targets' tab and check if any targets are failing health checks

11. If the health checks are failing, review your application code to ensure it's responding correctly to the health check requests

12. If necessary, update the task definition to include a startup script that ensures your application is fully initialized before accepting traffic

13. If you've made changes, update the ECS service with the new task definition

14. Monitor the service events and task status to ensure the new tasks pass the health checks

If you don't have permissions to do the following changes, contact your AWS Administrator:

15. If the issue persists, you may need to adjust the IAM role associated with the ECS task. Navigate to the IAM console

16. Find the task execution role used by your ECS tasks

17. Review the permissions and ensure it has the necessary permissions to interact with other AWS services your application might be using

18. If needed, add a policy to the role with the following permissions:
    ```json
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "elasticloadbalancing:DescribeTargetHealth",
                    "elasticloadbalancing:RegisterTargets",
                    "elasticloadbalancing:DeregisterTargets"
                ],
                "Resource": "arn:aws:elasticloadbalancing:us-east-1:322254080677:targetgroup/cfCont-Targe-9PKLMBOY5P8D/8209914af8a96bfe"
            }

    }
    ```
